# Bus Booking System in Python

This project is a **Bus Booking System** developed using Python. It allows users to book bus tickets, manage bookings, and interact with the system via a graphical interface. Key features include database management, user interaction, and an intuitive UI.

### Key Components:
- **Database (`bus_booking.db`)**: Stores bus schedules, bookings, and user information.
- **Python Scripts (`database.pyw`, `final.pyw`)**: The core logic for database interaction and booking operations.
- **Graphical Assets (`home.png`, `Bus_for_project.png`)**: Used for enhancing the user interface.
- **DLL Support (`fphtml.dll`)**: Extends functionality with additional resources.

This project can be expanded with additional features like payment integration, user authentication, and dynamic route management. Itâ€™s an excellent base for learning about database integration, GUI development, and project structuring in Python.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run `database.pyw` than `final.pyw` to launch the application interface.
